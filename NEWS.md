fasstr 0.4.0
=========================

Updated: 3 Dec 2021

#### Updates:

  * added flexible 'allowed_missing' argument to applicable functions, that allows users to choose the percentage of missing
    dates, rather than binary ignore_missing. ignore_missing argument still functions as it should (to maintain historical and
    future use), and is only superseded when allowed_missing argument is utilized. This argument is currently applied to functions 
    that make most logical sense (annual and monthly functions) and are appropriate for calculations, i.e. basin summary statistics
    (means, percentiles, minimums, maximums). Versions of this, allowed_missing_annual and allowed_missing_monthly, exists for some
    functions that have both annual and monthly statistics and may have different allowances; only applied to summary statistics.
    The new argument is applied to the following functions:
    * allowed_missing argument: calc_annual_lowflows(), calc_annual_peaks(), calc_annual_stats(), calc_monthly_stats(), 
      compute_annual_frequencies(), compute_frequency_quantile(), plot_annual_stats(), plot_annual_lowflows(), 
      plot_annual_means(), plot_monthly_stats() 
    * allowed_missing_annual and allowed_missing_monthly: calc_all_annual_stats(), compute_annual_trends(),
      compute_full_analysis(), write_full_analysis()
    
  * added 'months' argument to following functions (covers all screen_, calc_, plot_, and compute_ functions now):
    * plot_flow_data() - will plot only data from selected months
    * add_cumulative_yield() and add_cumulative_volume() - will accumulate flows just in selected months
    * plot_longterm_daily_stats() - no ribbons where data gaps
    * plot_longterm_monthly_stats() - no ribbons where data gaps
    * calc_ and plot_daily_cumulative_stats() - will accumulate flows just in selected months
    * calc_ and plot_monthly_cumulative_stats() - will accumulate flows just in selected months
    * calc_ and plot_annual_cumulative_stats() - will only use months select, won't calc seasonal totals if not all months
    * calc_ and plot_annual_flow_timing() - will use timing from just selected months
    * calc_all_annual_stats() - will only use months select, won't calc seasonal totals if not all months
    * compute_annual_trends() - will only use months select, won't calc seasonal totals if not all months
    * compute_ and write_full_analysis() - will only use months select, won't calc seasonal totals if not all months
    
  * Updated 'Users Guide' vignette and Cheat Sheet with new argument updates
  * New vignette for GitHub Page: Using USGS dataRetrieval R package with fasstr
  * fixed bug: multiple custom groups/STATION_NUMBER's appropriately match to data when using a named vector
  * fixed bug: plot_daily_cumulative_stats() now plots accurate custom years
  * fixed bug: removed unnecessary legend items from plot_flow_duration()
  * fixed bug: corrected 'months' argument in calc_ and plot_annual_outside_normal() to properly filter
  * fixed bug: removed unnecessary NA warning in plot_longterm_daily and plot_longterm_monthly_stats
  * renamed GitHub branches from 'master' to 'main' and updated web links
