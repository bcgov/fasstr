\usage{
plot_annual_cumulative_stats(data = NULL, dates = Date, values = Value,
  groups = STATION_NUMBER, station_number = NULL, use_yield = FALSE,
  basin_area = NA, water_year = FALSE, water_year_start = 10,
  start_year = 0, end_year = 9999, exclude_years = NULL,
  incl_seasons = FALSE, log_discharge = FALSE, include_title = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of daily data that contains columns of dates, flow values, and (optional) groups (e.g. station numbers).
Leave blank if using \code{station_number} argument.}

\item{dates}{Column in \code{data} that contains dates formatted YYYY-MM-DD. Only required if dates column name is not '
Date' (default). Leave blank if using \code{station_number} argument.}

\item{values}{Column in \code{data} that contains numeric flow values, in units of cubic metres per second.
Only required if values column name is not 'Value' (default). Leave blank if using \code{station_number} argument.}

\item{groups}{Column in \code{data} that contains unique identifiers for different data sets, if applicable. Only required if
groups column name is not 'STATION_NUMBER'. Function will automatically group by a column named 'STATION_NUMBER' if present.
Remove the 'STATION_NUMBER' column beforehand to remove this grouping. Leave blank if using \code{station_number} argument.}

\item{station_number}{A character string vector of seven digit Water Survey of Canada station numbers (e.g. \code{"08NM116"}) of
which to extract daily streamflow data from a HYDAT database. Requires \code{tidyhydat} package and a HYDAT database.
Leave blank if using \code{data} argument.}

\item{use_yield}{Logical value indicating whether to use yield runoff, in mm, instead of volumetric. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{basin_area}{Upstream drainage basin area, in square kilometres, to apply to observations. Three options:

(1) Leave blank if \code{groups} is STATION_NUMBER with HYDAT station numbers to extract basin areas from HYDAT.

(2) A single numeric value to apply to all observations.

(3) List each basin area for each group/station in groups (can override HYDAT value) as such \code{c("08NM116" = 795, 
"08NM242" = 10)}. Group not listed will result in NA basin area.}

\item{water_year}{Logical value indicating whether to use water years to group data instead of calendar years. Water years 
are designated by the calendar year in which they end. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{water_year_start}{Numeric value indicating the month of the start of the water year. Used if \code{water_year = TRUE}. 
Default \code{10}.}

\item{start_year}{Numeric value of the first year to consider for analysis. Leave blank to use the first year of the source data.}

\item{end_year}{Numeric value of the last year to consider for analysis. Leave blank to use the last year of the source data.}

\item{exclude_years}{Numeric vector of years to exclude from analysis. Leave blank to include all years.}

\item{incl_seasons}{Logical value indication whether to include seasonal yields and total discharges. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{log_discharge}{Logical value to indicate plotting the discharge axis (Y-axis) on a logarithmic scale. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_title}{Logical value to indicate adding the group/station number to the plot, if provided. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list of the following ggplot2 objects for each station provided:
  \item{Annual_Total_Volume}{annual total volumetric discharge, in cubic metres}
  \item{Two_Seasons_Total_Volume}{if include_seasons = TRUE, two seasons total volumetric discharges, in cubic metres}
  \item{Four_Seasons_Total_Volume}{if include_seasons = TRUE, four seasons total volumetric discharges, in cubic metres}
  If \code{use_yield} argument is used the list will contain the following objects:
  \item{Annual_Yield}{annual runoff yield, in millimetres}
  \item{Two_Seasons_Yield}{if include_seasons = TRUE, two seasons runoff yields, in millimetres}
  \item{Four_Seasons_Yield}{if include_seasons = TRUE, four seasons runoff yields, in millimetres}
}
\description{
Plots annual and seasonal total flows, volumetric or runoff yield flows, from a streamflow dataset. Calculates 
   the statistics from all daily discharge values from all years, unless specified. Data calculated from
   plot_annual_cumulative_stats() function. For water year and seasonal data, the designated
   year is the year in which the year or season ends. For example, if using water years with a start month of 11, the OND season is
   designated by the water year which starts in November (designated by the calendar year in which it ends).
