The Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R (`fasstr`) is a set of
[R](http://www.r-project.org) functions to tidy, summarize, analyze,
trend, and visualize streamflow data. This package summarizes continuous
daily mean streamflow data into various daily, monthly, annual, and
long-term statistics, completes annual trends and frequency analyses.

This package provides functions for streamflow data analysis, including:

-   data tidying (to prepare data for analyses; `add_*` and `fill_*`
    functions),
-   data screening (to identify data range, outliers and missing data;
    `screen_*` functions),
-   calculating summary statistics (long-term, annual, monthly and daily
    statistics; `calc_*`functions),
-   computing analyses (volume frequency analyses and annual trending;
    `compute_*` functions), and,
-   visualizing data (plotting the various statistics; `plot_*`
    functions).

Useful features of functions include:

-   the integration of the `tidyhydat` package to pull streamflow data
    from a Water Survey of Canada
    [HYDAT](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html)
    database for analyses;
-   arguments for filtering of years and months in analyses and
    plotting;
-   choosing the start month of your water year;
-   selecting for rolling day averages (e.g.Â 7-day rolling average);
    and,
-   choosing how missing dates are handled, amongst others.

This package is maintained by the [Water Protection and Sustainability
Branch of the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change
Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water).

### Installation

You can install `fasstr` directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fasstr):

``` r
install.packages("fasstr")
```

To install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/fasstr), use the
[`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package then the
`fasstr` package:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/fasstr")
```

To use the `station_number` argument and pull data directly from a
[Water Survey of Canada HYDAT
database](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html)
into `fasstr` functions, download a HYDAT file using the following code:

``` r
tidyhydat::download_hydat()
```

### Using fasstr

There are several vignettes and a cheatsheet to provide more information
on the usage of `fasstr` functions and how to customize various argument
options.
